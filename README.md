# Å½ana Flander website

## Introduction
I have created my website from scratch by using React. Website is not finished yet, because I am always adding new features or editing a style of the page.

## How I built the project
- I built the project from scratch with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- I used [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/) for styles.
- Initially the project was created in JavaScript, but later I migrated it to TypeScript.
