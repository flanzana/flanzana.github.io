# Å½ana Flander website

## Introduction
I have created my [personal website](https://flanzana.github.io) from scratch by using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and 
[`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/). Project was initially created in JavaScript and [Flow](https://flow.org/), 
but later I migrated it to TypeScript.

Website is not finished yet, because I am always adding new features or editing a style of the website. :)
